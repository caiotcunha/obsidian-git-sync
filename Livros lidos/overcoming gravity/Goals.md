It is important to re-assess your goals and your exercise selections every
five to six weeks.

Aim for fifteen reptitions of each exercice

The optional rule of thumb (for hypertrophy only): Beginners should
aim for ten sets of exercises per muscle group. -> tabela do carequinha?

The main reason to use workouts composed of three sets is
because working with 5-15 repetitions overall creates a good balance to get
into the 25-50 repetition strength range or the 40-75 repetition hypertrophy
range. You may use more or less than three sets depending on the amount of
volume you need.

One repetition of a concentric exercise is equal to about two
seconds of isometric hold.

pair sets uses half of the resting time
