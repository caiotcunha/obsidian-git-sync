Correctly applied bodyweight exercises are comparable to weights for strength and hypertrophy in the upper body. On the other hand, bodyweight exercises are slightly inferior to weights for strength and hypertrophy in the lower body. This is another key concept to keep in mind when assessing and constructing a routine toward your goals.

## SAID principle
SAID means Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands. If you apply enough stress to a muscle or nervous system it will adapt to the stress by improving strength and hypertrophy. To continue growing, it is important to progressive overload, meaning progressive applying more stress.

## Levarage
Progressive overload in bodyweight training is made through manipulating leverage. The goal is to decrease leverage in order to make the exercises more challenging. There is two ways of doing that: changing the body position and changing the muscle length.

### Changing the body position to decreases  leverage
Muscles are strongest in their resting lenght. The phenomenon of placing muscles into short or lengthened states at the edge of their range of motion is termed active insufficiency or passive insufficiency, respectively. Active tension is what you generate when you voluntarily contract your muscle, passive tension is when you hold a stretched position.

## Common training concepts
- Reps ->  The amount of repetitions you perform in a single set.
- Sets -> The number of repetitions you perform of a single exercise.
- Rests ->  The amount of time you take to rest between each set of an exercise. Shorter rest periods are typically better for endurance, while longer rest periods are typically better for strength. Rest times for muscular hypertrophy overlap with endurance and strength.
- Tempo -> The speed at which you execute repetitions. This may influence strength and hypertrophy. Typically, tempo is referred to in an XXXX format such as 10×0. Each “X” is a number of seconds per phase of the exercise.
	- First X – Seconds in the initial movement;
	- Second X – Seconds held at the terminal position; (Sometimes there are only two numbers)
	- Third X – Seconds in the counter movement;
	- Fourth X– Seconds held at the initial position before the next repetition.
- Intensity/Load -> The percentage of 1 repetition maximum (RM) that you use during a set.
- Volume -> The total amount of exercises performed in a workout. This can refer to the specific amount of total work on particular muscle groups, such as the pulling muscles (forearms, biceps, and back), or the total amount of work in a workout. Both are important in terms of programming for different populations.
- Frequency -> How often a workout or exercise is performed.
- Attribute -> A particular quality that is being trained. The primary attributes, which I have already discussed, are strength, hypertrophy, and endurance. However, there are other attributes, including flexibility, mobility, skill work, cardiovascular, stamina, and more. It is important to understand that different attributes can be trained at different frequencies.
- Failure -> the point at which you cannot perform another repetition with good form.
- Work capacity -> the ability to perform more exercise after adapting to the training program.
- Deload -> A planned period where various factors of a routine are reduced in order to allow the body to recover and increase work capacity, strength, hypertrophy, or other attributes. This may include one or all of the following reductions to the above factors: repetitions, sets, rests, tempo, intensity, volume, frequency, failure, and work capacity.
- Plateau -> a stagnation in the process of increasing an attribute.

## The repetition continuum
The repetition continuum has strength in one side and endurance in the other. The strength side is attained through low repetitions and heavier weight or higher intensity where 1 RM elicits the most strength. Endurance occurs with less weight or less intensity and more repetitions.
Important takes:
- strength and endurance cannot be both optimally developed at the same time.But you can train both at the same time if you want.
- developing maximal strength increases the potential for maximum endurance.
- strength take longer to develop then endurance and conditioning

In general if you are going to cross-train strength and endurance, but have a focus on one portion over another an 80/20 split  tends to work very well. *I want to focus on strength, so I'm planning on this split.*
Training like this is more beneficial then 100% focus on one train.
