In the human body, there are three different primary pathways that lead to hypertrophy. The first is mechanical tension. The second is eccentric damage via the popping sarcomere theory and microtrauma. The third is metabolic accumulation, local growth factors, hypoxia, and glycogen depletion based hypertrophy.

- **Mechanical Tension:** based hypertrophy tends to be activated via high
intensity exercises like heavy weights and fast movements.
- **Eccentric Damage and Microtrauma:** The intensity of an exercise is heavy enough to create damage to the muscles, but also light enough to perform for enough repetitions to create the damage. The accumulation of repetitions at a certain weight takes a certain amount of time to perform. This is what we discuss as an overall factor for hypertrophy when we talk about “volume” of the total exercises, sets, and repetitions for a particular muscle group.
- **Metabolite Accumulation, Local Growth Factors, Hypoxia, and the like:**  This can be thought of as low-intensity exercise with high amount of repetitions and volume. An example of this type of hypertrophy would be sports that have long, sustained endurance intensity with speed components.

Studies indicate that isometrics and eccentrics tend to recruit HTMUs right off the bat to sustain their contractions. This makes sense, as they are very difficult movements. The irony of eccentrics is that the studies on eccentric training seem to indicate that one-second eccentric movements are better at stimulating hypertrophy and strength adaptations than longer eccentrics, such as six seconds. This means that fast eccentrics preferentially activate the HTMUs, which have the greatest potential for power, strength, and hypertrophy.

The second primary concept you should take away from this section is the fact that overall volume in the context of frequency means the most in regard to hypertrophy. The volume of the exercise on particular muscles must exceed a certain threshold for hypertrophy, which in effect will increase as your muscles get bigger.

- If your goal is strength and hypertrophy, you will want to execute movements as explosively as possible with good technique. This will help recruit and stimulate the HTMUs, which are composed of fast-twitch fibers that carry the greatest potential for strength and hypertrophy. 
- Practice does not make perfect; perfect practice makes perfect.
- Training programs should include planned deloads to allow for proper recovery
- Eccentrics and isometrics can be used extremely effectively in a training program, but they should not make up the majority of your program because they are extremely taxing on the central nervous system.
- Hypertrophy tends to occur through three mechanisms: mechanical tension, eccentric damage and microtrauma, and local metabolic and hypoxic factors.
