• Strength – Primarily developed in the 1-8 RM range, best executed with close-to-failure (but not-to-failure training) and 3-minute rest times.
• Hypertrophy – Primarily developed in the 5-15+ RM range, best executed with failure training and anywhere from 1-3 minute rest times.
• Endurance – Primarily developed in the 15-20+ RM range, best executed with failure training and 30 to 90 second rest times.



mobility can be trained every day
flexibility no
Skill work that is focused on balance can be trained every day. Isometrics are not always skill work as planche, back lever, and front lever are never about balance, but training strength.


1. Warm-Up and Mobility
2. Skill or Technique Work (Handstands, Flips, Gymnastics Tumbling, Breakdancing Work, etc.)
3. Power, Isometrics, Eccentrics, Regular Strength Work
4. Endurance, Metabolic Conditioning, Tabata Method, Interval Training, Specific Exercises, etc.
5. Prehabilitation, Flexibility Work, Cool Down
