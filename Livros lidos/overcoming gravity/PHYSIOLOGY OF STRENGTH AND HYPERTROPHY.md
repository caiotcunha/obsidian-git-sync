Strength = Neural adaptations * Muscle cross sectional area

The Henneman’s size principle states that motor units are recruited from the smallest to largest. The LTMUs are considered the smallest and the HTMUs are considered the largest because of their physical size.

The type of training I want is for strength and hypertrophy. This type of training is performed by moving weights or your body weight close to maximal intensity, or with lower-intensity exercises performed rapidly with acceleration. This is the reason why I recommend a fast or accelerating tempo in the concentric phase of the movements, in order to ensure that HTMUs are being fatigued and the MTMUs are being trained to be like HTMUs—to induce gains in power, strength, and hypertrophy.

There are six primary ways that the nervous system increases strength, aside from the hypertrophy of muscles. These will be the primary adaptations in any strength program, so it is important to understand how they work.
- Recruitment is an increase in the number of motor units being
activated for a specific movement.
- Rate Coding or Firing Rate is a decrease in the time between
each electrochemical signal sent to the corresponding
musculature, which increases rate of contraction.
- Synchronization or Intra-muscular Coordination is a decrease
in the amount of time between motor units firing and working
together.
- Contribution or Inter-muscular Coordination is how effectively
timed the different contributing muscles to a movement are fired.
Antagonist Inhibition or Reciprocal Inhibition is a reduction of
resistance from the muscles opposite of those performing the
movement.
- Motor Learning refers to the neural connections and programs
within the brain that will affect your development of learning
movements.

Rate Coding matters very little for a strength-based program, but is useful to note for those seeking hypertrophy. Muscles that rely more on rate coding tend to be composed of a greater percentage of slow-twitch fibers. Therefore, they respond better to higher repetitions. Thus, the forearms,calves, core, and other highly-rated coded muscles tend to respond better to higher repetitions when you are seeking hypertrophy. On the other hand, two-joint muscles such as the hamstrings, biceps, and many of the larger muscles, such as the glutes, tend to respond best to more difficult exercises with fewer repetitions because of the preponderance of fast-twitch fibers. Ultimately, if your goal is massive amounts of hypertrophy you may need to alternate your repetition range, rest times, and other factors if one style of training does not seem to be working effectively.

Usually you want to train and have a deload time so you can rest the muscles and recover the nervous system.

concentric -> when contract
eccentric -> when stretch

Likewise, isometrics may be used in any weak point of the exercise, such as holding the position at the top of the bar (if that is a weak point). All of these tend to fatigue the body more than typical concentric repetitions. Thus, when working with many of these types of exercises each week—or even in a single session—one has to be aware that a plateau in progress may indicate that the best way to achieve progress may be more rest instead of more exercise, which is contrary to what beginners often think when they begin working out.
