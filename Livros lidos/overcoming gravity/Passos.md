1. Linear progression or linear repetition progression is first. If possible,
add repetitions or improve your progressions every workout. Do this for
most of the beginner phase of training.
2. Simple intra- and inter-exercise progressions are next. You will want to
increase the number of repetitions or progressions every other workout or
so. Do this from the end of the beginner phase of training through the
beginning of the intermediate phase.
3. Simple periodization is next. Utilize accumulation and intensification
phases in training or the light/heavy model of changing the repetitions from
workout to workout. Do this during the mid-intermediate to late-
intermediate phase of training.
4. Daily undulating periodization (DUP) works exceedingly well as you
move into the upper intermediate and advanced phases of training.
5. When you are midway through the advanced level of training or beyond,
a hybridized light/heavy DUP type system is effective. You may also want
to start experimenting with concurrent or conjugate models of periodization
if you are having trouble progressing.
6. At the elite level of training, a concurrent or conjugate system will likely
work best.
