Goals must be set using the SMART model: Specific, Measurable, Action-Oriented, Realistic, Time-Bound.

First, it is important to categorize goals based on how many you can work
at a time. In general, **you will want one to two goals from each category for
skill, pushing, pulling, legs, core, and flexibility**. For the most part, the only
skill goals we will discuss in this book, aside from sport-specific technique,
will be handstands. Pushing is straightforward: pushup variations, dip
variations, handstand pushup variations, and planche. Pulling is
straightforward: back lever, front lever, iron cross, pull-up variations and
row variations. Legs are also straightforward, as are core and flexibility.
