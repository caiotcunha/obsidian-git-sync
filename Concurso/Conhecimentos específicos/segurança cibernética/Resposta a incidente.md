# Tipos de incidente
- **Malware Infections**
- **Security Breaches:** Security Breaches arise when an unauthorized person gets access to confidential data (something we don’t want them to see or have).  Security Breaches are of the utmost importance as many businesses rely on their confidential data, which must only be accessible to authorized personnel.
- **Data Leaks:** Data leaks are incidents in which confidential information of an individual or an organization is exposed to unauthorized entities. Many attackers use data leaks for reputational damage to their victims or use this technique to threaten their victims and get what they need from them. Unlike Security Breaches, data leaks can also be unintentionally caused by human errors or misconfigurations.
- **Insider Attacks:** Incidents from within an organization are known as insider attacks. Think about a disgruntled employee infecting the whole network through a USB on his last day. This is an example of an insider attack. Someone within your organization intentionally initiating an attack comes under this category. These attacks can be hazardous, as an insider always has greater access to resources than an outsider.
- **Denial Of Service Attacks:** Availability is one of the three pillars of cyber security. Defensive security solutions and people constantly find ways to protect information; they ensure that the data is available to the people simultaneously. This is because there is no point in protecting something that is unavailable to us. Denial of Service attacks, or DoS attacks, are incidents where the attacker floods a system/network/application with false requests, eventually making it unavailable to legitimate users. This happens due to the exhaustion of resources available to entertain the requests.

# Técnicas
- **SIEM:** The Security Information and Event Management Solution (SIEM) collects all important logs in one centralized location and correlates them to identify incidents.
- **AV:** Antivirus (AV) detects known malicious programs in a system and regularly scans your system for these.
- **EDR:** Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is deployed on every system, protecting it against some advanced-level threats. This solution can also contain and eradicate the threat.
