	- Hashing: Map data of an arbitrary langht to data of a fixed length
	- Digital signatures
	- Certificates
	- Non-repudiation: garantee that the author made the action in question
- Avaliability
	- Systems and networks must be up and running
	- Redundancy

- Proof of integrity
	- Verify data does not change
	- we can use hash for that
- Proof of origin
	- Prove the source of the message
	- Make sure signature isn't fake
	- Sign with the private key
